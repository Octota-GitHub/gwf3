Hello Hacker,<br/>
<br/>
As you know, i am constantly developing great new websites.<br/>
<br/>
But this time, i am puzzled...<br/>
Somehow, hackers broke into my new site &quot;<a href="%s">The Mime Files</a>&quot;
and read the contents of solution.php.<br/>
<br/>
OUCH!<br/>
<br/>
Can you help me to find the vulnerability?<br/>
<br/>
To help you out you can peek at the source again on <a href="%s">github</a>.
